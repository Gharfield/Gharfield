- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Gharfield. I come from an background as a chef. I've been working in the industry for about 6 years.
When i reached my early 20s i wanted to try something else, and that's why i wanted to take my knowledge and share it with other people.
Why i went to coding was because i wanted to reach out to as many people as possible, so they can evovle their cooking skills and communicate since food is
a huge part of our lives.
So thatÂ´s why Iâ€™m interested in coding recepies apps,

- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
